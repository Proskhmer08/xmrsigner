- Snap fit 3D-printed enclosure, no screws or spacers needed.
- This enclosure requires use of the so called "zerocam", which allows for a more compact form factor.
- Comfortable handling experience with joystick, trackball and buttons printed from TPU
- Top and bottom part snap fit together.


### Printing tips
- XmrSigner_Bottom.3mf and XmrSigner_Top.3mf are ready for multicolor printing but can also be printed in a single color.
- .3mf files are very similar to .stl files and can be opened by any slicer software.
- Files are preoriented for optimal printing, no supports required.
- The included controls can be printed from PLA, but TPU is recommended.
- Recommended shore hardness is 95A, but any TPU will work.


### Assembly

Assembling this is straightforward. Insert the Pi Zero with attached camera (and inserted microsd card) at an angle, align the micro sd port to the micro sd slot, lightly press the Pi Zero in, then put the Waveshare LCD hat on top, press down on its sides (don't press directly on the LCD) and it will click into place. Now position joystick and buttons and close the case.
