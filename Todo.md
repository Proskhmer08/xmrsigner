# Todo
- [ ] Check again compact seed, write test code to catch the issue
## Backend
- [.] [monero-python](https://github.com/DiosDelRayo/monero-python/Todo.md): monero seed encryption/decryption * not part of the CCS, delayed how it seems a rabbit hole (>48h work)
## Seeds
### Seed
- [.] Convert 14 words feather wallet seeds to monero 25 words seed (future)
#### Load seed
- [?] Enter 14 words feather wallet seed (think should be supported in future)
### Advanced
- [-] Monero seed passphrase, __not viable at the moment, excluded from the CCS, to be done with calm (#rabbit-hole)__
## Other things
- [ ] Modify [Monero GUI](https://github.com/DiosDelRayo/monero-gui)
- [ ] remove old font if unused
- [ ] check how to generate font to include monero logo
---
## Considerations:
- [?] Shoud feather wallet 14 words seed be offered to be imported?
